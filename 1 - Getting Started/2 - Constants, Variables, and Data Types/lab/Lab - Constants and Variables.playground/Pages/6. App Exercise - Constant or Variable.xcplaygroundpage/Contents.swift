 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Tom"
print("I declared a constant because the users' name will not change.")
var age = 25
print("I declared a variable because the users' age will increase each year.")
var numberOfStepsToday = 3000
print("I declared a variable because the users' number of steps evolves.")
let goalNumberOfSteps = 5000
print ("I declared a constant because the users' goal number of steps is not suppose to change once set.")
var averageHeartRate = 200
print ("I declared a variable because the users' average heart rate evolves.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
